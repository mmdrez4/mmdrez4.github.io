I’m **Mohammadreza Daviran**, an M.Sc. student in Computer Science in the [DaLI Lab](https://dalilab.ca/) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en), conducting research under the supervision of Prof. [Davood Rafiei](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~drafiei/). My research lies at the intersection of **data management** and **natural language processing**, with a focus on how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to make databases more accessible and intelligent. I study problems such as query mapping across heterogeneous schemas, schema matching, and text-to-SQL generation, aiming to build systems that reliably translate user intent into executable queries across diverse domains.  

Broadly, I’m interested in Data Management, Database Systems, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Information Retrieval. My long-term goal is to connect database systems with language technologies to build adaptive and reliable methods for understanding and working with both structured and unstructured data in real-world settings.
