Iâ€™m **Mohammadreza Daviran**, an M.Sc. student in Computing Science at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en), conducting research under the supervision of Prof. [Davood Rafiei](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~drafiei/). My research lies at the intersection of **data management** and **natural language processing**, with a focus on how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to make databases more accessible and intelligent. I study problems such as query mapping across heterogeneous schemas, schema matching, and text-to-SQL generation, aiming to build systems that reliably translate user intent into executable queries across diverse domains.  

Broadly, my interests span Data Management, Database Systems, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Information Retrieval. My long-term goal is to bridge database systems and language technologies, enabling adaptive and trustworthy query understanding in real-world settings.

For more details about my background and experience, please see my [Curriculum Vitae](/cv/).
