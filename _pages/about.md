I’m **Mohammadreza Daviran**, an M.Sc. student in Computing Science at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en), advised by Prof. [Davood Rafiei](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~drafiei/).  

My research lies at the intersection of **data management** and **natural language processing**, with a focus on how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to make databases more accessible and intelligent. I study problems such as **query mapping across heterogeneous schemas**, **schema matching and mappability prediction**, and **text-to-SQL generation**, aiming to build systems that reliably translate user intent into executable queries across diverse domains.  

Broadly, my interests span **Data Management**, **Database Systems**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Information Retrieval**. My long-term goal is to bridge database systems and language technologies, enabling adaptive and reliable query understanding across diverse domains.
