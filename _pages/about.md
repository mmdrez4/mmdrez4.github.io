Iâ€™m **Mohammadreza Daviran**, an M.Sc. student in Computing Science at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en), conducting research under the supervision of Prof. [Davood Rafiei](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~drafiei/). My research lies at the intersection of **data management** and **natural language processing**, with a focus on how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to make databases more accessible and intelligent. I study problems such as query mapping across heterogeneous schemas, schema matching, and text-to-SQL generation, aiming to build systems that reliably translate user intent into executable queries across diverse domains.  

Broadly, Iâ€™m interested in Data Management, Database Systems, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Information Retrieval. My long-term goal is to connect database systems with language technologies to build adaptive and reliable methods for understanding and working with both structured and unstructured data in real-world settings.
