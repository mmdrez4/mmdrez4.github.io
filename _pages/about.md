I’m an M.Sc. student in Computing Science at the University of Alberta (Rafiei Lab), working on **SQL-Exchange** (cross-schema SQL query mapping) and **schema matching / mappability** with large language models. I’m broadly interested in **Data Management**, **NLP**, **Information Retrieval**, **LLMs**, **Database Systems**, and **Text-to-SQL**.
